# Introduction

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## About the project

For this project I have used **mongoDB**, classified as a **NoSQL** database program that uses **JSON** like documents with schemas.

## Tests

Initially the database is built and tested on a local machine using **ROBO-3T** schema that allows the user to create and test collections by connecting it to `localhost`
To test the mongo connection to your local machine

**1.Run the following command** (_mac-users_) ❗️ - `mongo`

**2.Open 2nd command line** - `npm run seed`

**3.Run the this command to start your server** - `npm start`

## Usage

In this full-stack application the user can successfully track their workout progress as well as stats handled by the program.

**Workout variations**
-Cardio
-Resistance

User can visually review the progress
